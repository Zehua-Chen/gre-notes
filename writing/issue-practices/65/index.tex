      social stability is maintained
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Countries/regions where just is being trampled, anarchy
        prevails accordingly; Ex. Somalia, The Golden Triangle,
        Wartime Europe
      \end{itemize}

      \item Meanwhile, social progress becomes an easier prospect
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The US Constitution; The Bills of Rights
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{不赞同}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \important{History has suggested that, collectively, lawmakers
      around the world would often distort the definition of justice}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The final solution by Nazis

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Fighting against laws that are in violation of ethical codes
      is an act of pursuing basic humans rights
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Slavery: Harriet Tubman - The Moses of Slaves
      \end{itemize}

      \item To promote our personal wellbeing ad that of the community we
      live in, both of which are taken by force of law from us, we have to
      challenge the injustice
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Stamp Act 1712 - stamp duty

    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{不赞同}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A law may be deemed as unjust by an individual
      (i.e. subjective), but is in fact just considering from the
      perspective of the society
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Reservation of Native Americans

      \say{with great power comes great responsibility}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Harriet Tubman vs Abraham Lincoln: 还是得靠大人物解决问题
      \end{itemize}

      \item Laws of the modern world evolved on their own through
      legal process of legislation
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Amendments to the United States Constitution
      \end{itemize}

      \item Under the rule of law, all members of society
      (including those in government) are considered equally subject to
      publicly disclosed legal codes and processes. Those who feel deprived
      of their deserved rights can simply file a lawsuit against the law
      they seem unjust
