  \section{Assumptions}

    \paragraph{Assumption 1} It is because the 75 percent of those did not
    wear any gears that they suffered from injuries during roller-skating
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Challenge the cause (data): 文章没有给出比例的基数
      \item Point out the lack of experiment or survey: 文章的数据不是通过实验
      得到
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 范文给了\say{controlled experiment}
      \end{itemize}

      \item Offer alternative explanation (hard): 在大街上滑旱冰的会做危险动作,
      有可能是危险动作导致了受伤
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Assumption 2} Those with gears that have prevented them from
    getting injured are wearing high-quality ones.

    \paragraph{Assumption 3} Those going to the hospital after roller-skating
    accidents were severly injured. (Roller skaters may be skating after
    regular hospital hours has closed, because they are either students
    or professionals and therefore duties to attend during daytime. Therefore,
    they have to go to emergench room)

    \paragraph{Last Resort 1} (Nessicity) There are no better ways to prevent
    injuries for roller skaters. (Schools should be educating skaters to not
    skate on the stree)

    \paragraph{Last Resort 2} (Advantage vs. Disadvantage)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Good equipments are too expensive
      \item \textbf{同意结论, 不同意推理过程}: high-quality equipments would make
      skaters overly-confident (ex. the invention of seat-belts)
    \end{itemize}
