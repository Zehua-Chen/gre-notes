\section{Q1}

  A mixture of 12 ounces of vinegar and oil is 40 percent vinegar, where all
  of the measurements are by weight. How many ounces of oil must be added to
  the mixture to produce a new mixture that is only 25 percent vinegar?

  \subsection{解析}

    \begin{align*}
      v &= 12 \times 0.4 \\
      &= 4.8 \\
      \frac{4.8}{12 + x} &= 0.25 \\
      x &= 0.72
    \end{align*}

    mixture的重量是所有组成部分的总和
